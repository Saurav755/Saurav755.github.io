# My First Website

Welcome to my first website project! This project is a basic implementation of a website using only HTML and CSS. It's designed to showcase fundamental web development skills, including layout design, styling, and responsive design principles.

## Project Structure

This project consists of a main HTML file that serves as the entry point to the website and several CSS files that handle the styling aspects. Here is a brief overview of the file structure:

- `index.html` - The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- `css/` - A directory containing all the CSS files.
  - `style.css` - The primary stylesheet that includes general styling rules for the website.
  - `responsive.css` - An optional stylesheet that includes media queries for responsive design, making the website adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Features

This website includes the following features:

- **Navigation Bar**: A simple navigation bar that allows users to navigate through the website sections.
- **Content Sections**: Multiple sections including About Me, Projects, and Contact Information.
- **Footer**: A footer section that includes copyright information and social media links.
